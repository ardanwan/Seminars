This file describes the workings of 'function_2b' from the assignments.
The function takes two strings. First, the function creates three strings, 'lower', 'upper' 
and 'combined'. 'lower' will correspond to the first string in lower case. 'upper' to the second string
in upper case. 'combined' corresponds to both strings attached in their original form (lower- and 
uppercase wise). The function returns a dictionary, where the keys are 'L', 'U', and 'C', and the values
are the corresponding newly created strings.
