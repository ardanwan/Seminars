documentation and see if he can work with it.

Documentation: 

Function_2b has 2 parameters as input. string_1 and string_2.
The python .lower() function is applied on string_1 and stored in the variable lower
The .upper() function is applied on string_2 and stored in the variable upper.
Then in the variable 'combined'  string_2 is appended to string_1.

The function returns a dictionary. This dictionary contains 3 elements:
The first element with key "L" refers to the result of the .lower function on string_1.
The key "U" refers to the result of the .upper function on string_2.
And the "C" key refers to the result of the combined strings.
