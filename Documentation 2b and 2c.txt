Function 2b takes two strings as arguments and creates three new strings: str lower which is the first string in lowercase, str upper which is the second string in uppercase, and str combined which is the concatenation of the original first and second strings.

The function then creates a dictionary named "dict" which lists "L" followed by str lower, "U" followed by string upper, and "C" followed by string combined.

The function then returns dict.

=====
Function 2c takes four numbers as arguments and performs four operations for which it creates new corresponding variables: multiplication between the 2nd and 3rd arguments, division of the 2nd arg. by the 3rd, addition of the 1st and 4th args., and subtraction of the 1st arg. from the 4th.

The function then creates a dictionary named "results" that lists the four operations followed by their values.

The function then returns results.
